# Galaxy-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning

Galaxies have always been an enigmatic and broad concept for our understanding. Typically, they comprise a bright radiant central point surrounded by millions of tiny stars, which makes it highly difficult to differentiate one galaxy from another with human vision. However, machine learning can aid us in this regard. By employing a convolution neural network (CNN) model trained on a large collection of galaxy images from the “Galaxy10 DECals Dataset,” we can classify galaxy images with high precision, achieving an accuracy rate of 0.74.
